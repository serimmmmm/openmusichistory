Alessandro Scarlatti (1660–1725) is an Italian composer who played a crucial role in establishing the Neapolitan opera tradition during the Baroque period, a time when music was becoming increasingly expressive, ornate, and structured around contrast and drama. He codified the da capo aria, which became central to Baroque vocal music and served as a structural model for arias throughout the 18th century. Scarlatti composed over 600 cantatas that remain essential for the study of the period, reflecting the Baroque interest in emotional expression, formal clarity, and vocal virtuosity. His influence extended beyond his own work through his son, [Domenico Scarlatti](scarlatti_domenico_keyboard_sonata_k80.md), who became a renowned composer in his own right. The elder Scarlatti’s mastery of vocal and dramatic forms helped shape Domenico’s early musical education, laying the foundation for his later innovations in keyboard music.

## Life Story
He was born in Palermo, Sicily, in 1660. Around the age of twelve, he moved to Rome, where he is believed to have studied music under Giacomo Carissimi. His early works suggest influences from Stradella and Legrenzi, indicating a possible connection to northern Italian musical trends of the time. Following the successful premiere of his opera Gli equivoci nel sembiante in 1679, he gained the patronage of Queen Christina of Sweden, residing in Rome, and became her maestro di cappella. In 1684, he took a significant position as maestro di cappella at the court of the Viceroy in Naples, a city that would become the epicenter of Italian opera. Naples, during the Baroque era, was a thriving cultural and political hub under Spanish rule, and Scarlatti’s music responded to the demands of a court culture that valued both spectacle and refinement. His long service there contributed to the solidification of the Neapolitan style, characterized by clear melodic lines, dramatic contrasts, and expressive ornamentation—all hallmarks of the Baroque aesthetic.

## Why Important
His work laid the foundation for Classical opera, and his techniques in orchestration—particularly his use of instrumental color and texture—significantly influenced the development of later symphonic writing. Scarlatti’s music reflects the larger Baroque emphasis on emotional depth, formal structure, and contrasts between solo and ensemble textures. He was also a central figure in the evolution of recitative and aria forms, which would become standard in opera for the next century. I was drawn to Scarlatti because, although he is not as frequently mentioned as some other composers, he was instrumental in shaping the structural and expressive core of Baroque vocal music. His codification of the da capo aria and immense cantata output provide a fascinating starting point for exploring how his work influenced later Classical composers like Handel, Mozart, and even Haydn, who inherited the expressive vocabulary and formal clarity that Scarlatti helped define within his historical context.
