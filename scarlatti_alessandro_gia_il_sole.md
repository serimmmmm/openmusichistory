Alessandro Scarlatti (1660–1725) is an Italian composer who played a crucial role in establishing the Neapolitan opera tradition. He codified the da capo aria, which became central to Baroque vocal music, and composed over 600 cantatas that remain essential for the study of the period. His influence extended beyond his own work through his son, [Domenico Scarlatti](scarlatti_domenico_keyboard_sonata_k80.md), who became a renowned composer in his own right. The elder Scarlatti’s mastery of vocal and dramatic forms helped shape Domenico’s early musical education, laying the foundation for his later innovations in keyboard music.

## Life Story
He was born in Palermo, Sicily, in 1660. Around the age of twelve, he moved to Rome, where he is believed to have studied music under Giacomo Carissimi. His early works suggest influences from Stradella and Legrenzi, indicating a possible connection to northern Italian musical trends. Following the successful premiere of his opera "Gli equivoci nel sembiante" in 1679, he gained the patronage of Queen Christina of Sweden, residing in Rome, and became her maestro di cappella. In 1684, he took a significant position as maestro di cappella at the court of the Viceroy in Naples, where he remained for many years, composing prolifically for the opera house and courtly events.

## Why Important
His work laid the foundation for Classical opera, and his techniques in orchestration—particularly his use of instrumental color and texture—significantly influenced the development of later symphonic writing. I was drawn to Scarlatti because, although he is not as frequently mentioned as some other composers, he was instrumental in shaping the structural and expressive core of Baroque vocal music. His codification of the da capo aria and immense cantata output provide a fascinating starting point for exploring how his work influenced later Classical composers.
