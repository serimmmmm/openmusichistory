## Introduction to the History of Western Music Open-Source Textbook
This textbook is a collaborative project created by students in the "History of Western Music 3 & 4" courses at Hanyang University. Using the tools of open-source development, we aim to present an evolving account of Western music history that reflects each student's perspective and analysis. Each section of this textbook is devoted to key works by composers who have shaped the course of music from the 10th to the 20th century and beyond. Through these contributions, students explore the distinctive qualities and innovations of each piece, offering insights into the broader historical and stylistic currents they represent.

This project also contributes to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) by promoting inclusive and equitable quality education. By engaging students in the collaborative creation of an open-source textbook, the course fosters participatory learning and provides accessible educational resources that can benefit a global audience, ensuring lifelong learning opportunities for all.
